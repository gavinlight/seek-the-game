      <Paragraph center>A small gust of wind flew across Damien’s face, he opened his eyes and looked around</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>“Where am I?” Damien said to himself, as he looked around. He was standing on a small grassy road in the middle of the night. Small lanterns were hanging across both sides of the road, where trees were scattered across all sides. The sky was completely dark, no stars, moon, or clouds to be seen. He could only hear the sound of leaves softly waving in the wind. Disorientated, he slowly began to move forward.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph right>“How did I get here?” Crossed his mind while he looked up to the sky, “I have no memories of this place." Damien's mind was all vague, as he could not remember a thing. He looked down the path, and a mountain could be seen in the distance. As Damien walked down the path, the mountain grew in size. The path was leading to a small cave, hidden behind boxes and barrels.“What is this place?” Damien said to himself as started removing the objects. There was a tight opening, which appeared not to have been created by humans. The ground was moist, as he heared raindrops dripping from stalactites. He noticed a light flickering far away in the cave and wind drafted past him, indicating that there was an other end. The atmosphere made Damien feel uncomfortable. It was like something was lurking for him somewhere deep within the cave. Damien was hesitating before entering. He looked around, hoping to find a different path. There was nothing. <strong>He took a deep breath and entered the cave..</strong></Paragraph>
